#What is a count min sketch ?


#What are the advantages ?
We increment some counters, but our space allocated is constant.
We can add million of events and out programm should run in the same amount of time/memory.
O(1) algorithm

#When should we use it ?
Massive number of items
Different types of items
Items do not need to store

#What are some use cases ?
How many times did people watch Gangnam style ?
“Hello” is more popular than “History of Japan” ?

#Problem
VideoOne is incrementing the 5,1,4,4 index
VideoTwo is incrementing the 3,9,3,4 index

We are checking the count of a never watched VideoThree
The result of the hash function is 3,1,4,4 (mi value is 1...)

The output of Hash functions for VideoThree was : 3,1,4,4

getCount for VideoThree : min (2,1,1,3)

But, VideoThree is never watched
