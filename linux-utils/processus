#What is a daemon ?
An process running in background and not interactive (no TTY)
They are the processes which run in the background and are not interactive. They have no controlling terminal
They perform certain actions at predefined times or in response to certain events

#Example
    initd
    systemd
    dockerd
    somethingd

#What is a process ?
One or more threads of execution together with their shared set of resources.

#Example
    A shell script or a cmd (background or foreground for performance)

#What is a service ?
A service can be multiple processes
#Example
    httpd is a service
    But you can have 10-20 apache processes runnning in background (handling requests)
    ssh, web server, database server, system logger

#What is a socket ?
Inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism that allows bidirectional data exchange between processes.

#What is a Unix socket ?
Inter-process communication (IPC) running on the same host.
Use the filesystem
#Example
/var/run/docker.sock (for docker)

#What is an IP socket ?
IPC running over the network (often TCP/IP)
