#What is a protocol ?
Rules of communication possible.
They define a common language clients use to find each other, connect and transport informations

#What is an IP adress ?
#Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.
TCP/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network (an intranet or an extranet).
TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications.
Those communications identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination.
TCP/IP requires little central management, and it is designed to make networks reliable, with the ability to recover automatically from the failure of any device on the network.

IP defines how to address and route each packet to make sure it reaches the right destination.
Each gateway computer on the network checks this IP address to determine where to forward the message.

#How TCP/IP works ?
TCP/IP uses the client/server model of communication 
        => A user or machine (client) is provided a service (like sending a webpage) by another computer (a server) in the network.
        => Classified as stateless
        => Meaning each client request is considered unrelated to previous requests

#Explanation
When a client process wants to connect a server, the client must have a way of identifying the server that it wants to connect.
If the client knows the IP address (32-bit or 4 bytes) of the host on which the server resides, it can contact that host.
    #How does the client identify the particular server process running on that host?
        To resolve the problem of identifying a particular server process running on a host, both TCP and UDP have defined a group of well-known ports.
        #What is a port ?
        For our purpose, a port is an integer number between 1024 and 65535.
        Port numbers < 1024 are considered well-known
        #Example :
        telnet : port 23
        http   : port 80
        ftp    : port 21
        ssh    : port 22
        smtp   : port 25 / port 587
        #Where can I find information about port assignments to network services ?
        /etc/services

#Check if a port is opened
netstat -ntupl (deprecated)
ss -ntupl
#Output
