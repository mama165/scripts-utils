#Explanation
When a client process wants to connect a server, the client must have a way of identifying the server that it wants to connect.
If the client knows the IP address (32-bit or 4 bytes) of the host on which the server resides, it can contact that host.
    #How does the client identify the particular server process running on that host?
        To resolve the problem of identifying a particular server process running on a host, both TCP and UDP have defined a group of well-known ports.
        #What is a port ?
        For our purpose, a port is an integer number between 1024 and 65535.
        Port numbers < 1024 are considered well-known
        #Example :
        telnet : port 23
        http   : port 80
        ftp    : port 21
        ssh    : port 22
        smtp   : port 25 / port 587
        #Where can I find information about port assignments to network services ?
        /etc/services

#Check if a port is opened
netstat -ntupl (deprecated)
ss -ntupl
#Output
