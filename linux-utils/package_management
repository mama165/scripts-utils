#What's a package ?
A set of programs

#What is Package Management ?
Method of installing, updating, removing and maintaining softwares on the system.

#Why is there Package Management ?
Before, programs were distributed as source code, with man pages, configuration files...
Nowadays, Linux distributors use pre-built programs or packages...
These programs are presented to users ready for installation on that distribution.

#How Package Management works ?
Its all about dependencies.
If a certain package requires a certain resource such as a shared library, or another package, it is said to have a dependency. 
All modern package management systems provide some method of dependency resolution to ensure that when a package is installed, all of its dependencies are installed as well.

#What is YUM ?
Yum (Yellowdog Updater Modified) is an open source tool for automating package maintenance
for a network of workstations running any operating system that use the Red Hat Package Management (RPM) system 
for distributing packaged tools and applications.

#What is a YUM repository ?
A yum repository is a collection of RPM packages with metadata that is readable by the yum command line tool.
It allows us to perform package install, removal, upgrade and operations on individual packages or group of packages.
Yum repositories are essential for storing, managing, and delivering software to end systems.


#What are the package tools ?
In order to perform the task of package management effectively, you need to be aware that you will have two types of available utilities: low-level tools (which handle in the backend the actual installation, upgrade, and removal of package files), and high-level tools (which are in charge of ensuring that the tasks of dependency resolution and metadata searching -”data about the data”- are performed).

DISTRIBUTION	            LOW-LEVEL TOOL	        HIGH-LEVEL TOOL
Debian and derivatives	         dpkg	           apt-get / aptitude
CentOS	                         rpm	                  yum
