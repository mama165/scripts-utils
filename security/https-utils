#How does an HTTP connection works ?

Alice : server
Bob : client
Smith : certification authority

Before Bob (client) establishes a connection with Alice (server)
    Alice generates a (public,private) key.
    Alice sends public key to Smith.
    Smith checks Alice identity.
    Smith signs Alice public key with his private key and create a certificate.
    Alice receives the certificate.

After
    Bob needs a secure connection
    Alice sends the certificate (contains the public key).
    Bob checks if certificate has been signed by Smith (root certificate).
    Bob gets Alice public key from the certificate.
    Bob generates a symetric key.
    Bob crypts the key with Alice public key.
    Bob send the key to Alice.
    Alice decrypts the key (previously crypted with the public key) with the private key
