#Why service discovery ?
The cloud architecture i changing the way we build web applications that we are moving from large monoliths to microservices.
If A needs to communicate with B, A have to know the IP adress & port.
The easiest solution is by maintaining a configuration file that holds the IP adress and port to B at A.
#Cons
When the numbr of micro-services increases :
- Configuration files are difficult to manage
- It is error prone when some mismanagement happens
- Lacks the flexibility to change the IP or port in a later point of time
#Alternative solution
Service discovery helps to solve the above problem by providing a way to  :
- Register a service ie when a new service becomes online it registers itself to the service discovery service with its IP and port
- Helps a service to find an other one (A will find B)
- Helth check the health of insta,ce and to remove it when it is not well
- Deregister when a service becomes offline

Thus we obtain a dynamically scale cloud architecture.
Thus the it is loosely coupled to each other


#What is Consul ?
Consul is a cluster management tool from Hashicorp.
It is very useful for creating advanced micro-services architecture.

#Main features ?
Distributed configuration system
High availability
Multi-data center
Service discovery
High fault tolerance
Health check

#How does it work ?
Consul is an agent-based tool running within the nodes where services are running.

#What about UI ?
A client agent can user for UI and query the information about the cluster of servers.

#Where can I found a demo ?
